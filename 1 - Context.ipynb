    "Modeled after the brain, perceptions are like neurons and synapses in the human brain. A high enough electrical current can activate neurons and send signals through the corresponding synapse.\n",
    "Once the signal is sent, the neuron turns off. Higher number of activations strengthens the neurons and becomes more important. \n",
    "The way all the neurons connect with each other with its varying strengths of connections can help us respond to external stimuli though some kind of output.\n",
